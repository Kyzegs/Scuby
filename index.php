                    Ever wondered how many pesky Enderman you've slain? Or perhaps how much time you've wasted swimming
                    when you could've used a boat? No? Neither have I. But if you do wonder about your statistics by the
                    odd chance, you'll be able to see them on this website. Not satisfied with just that? We also have a
                    map of the server that updates real-time. You'll be able to stalk all of your fellow Minecraft
                    players.
                </p>
                <p>
                    What exactly is Scuby? Scuby is a Minecraft server consisting out of a small group of friends. The
                    server uses a mod called TerraForged for it's terrain generation. It also has a few plugins to add
                    some much needed features. We do try to keep the core experience as close to vanilla Minecraft as
                    possible by not adding mods/plugins that change the way the game is played. We also like to make
                    accomplishments feel more rewarding. We did this by putting the server in Hardcore. This makes the
                    stakes higher and the feeling of getting those sweet glittery diamonds all that much better.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You can join the Scuby server by using the the following server address:
                    <span class="hl">play.scuby.online</span>. You'll need to be on version 1.15.2 of Minecraft to play on
                    the server. Any malicious intent towards any of our users will lead to an immediate ban. Griefing
                    will yield the same result.
